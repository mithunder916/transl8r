# transl8r

App that turns text input into sounds.

Implement:
- parsing a dictionary to learn part of speech, tense, meaning/emotion, anything about the word that might factor into how it affects the sound produced

- a set of functions, maybe within a class, to turn text input into melodic arrangements for Tone.js instruments
  - ideas: length of word: duration, part of speech: velocity, meaning: pitch, ???: time signature
  - first word could determine the scale/mode played. successive words determine which intervals follow
    - could be limited by basic voice leading rules, like no leaps


- what if you could choose to play multiple lines at the same time? and it arranged a harmony.

- a sick UI
